# Overview of the analysis: 
This analysis is being used to investigate Amazon reviews. Specifically it is looking at how a product having a vine review influence's its performance.

For the purpose of this analysis I chose to look at the apparel dataset but this same analysis could be applied to any item type amazon tracks.

# Summary: 

With the limited subset available with this dataset only 33 vine reviews of over 45,000 total reviews. There seems to be a closely correlated ratio of five star to non-five star reviews in both cases. 45% to 52%. Due to the limited number of reviews in the vine dataset I would do an analysis that looks more closely at those 33 products and investigate the reviews specifically associated with them comparing vine verses non vine reviews and see how they compare.
